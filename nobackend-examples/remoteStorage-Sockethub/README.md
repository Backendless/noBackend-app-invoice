About Sockethub

About unhosted web apps
------------------------

[unhosted web apps](https://unhosted.org/), also known as "serverless", 
"client-side", or "static" web apps, unhosted web apps do not send your
user data to their server. Either you connect your own server at runtime,
or your data stays within the browser.
