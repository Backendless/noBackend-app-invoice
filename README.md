Editable Invoice
==================

<a href="http://nobackend.github.io/example-invoice/">

</a>

The very first [noBackend](http://nobackend.org/) example app, to showcase how an HTML prototype can be turned into a real product in a matter of hours.

The code is quite hacky at the moment, we gratefully accept pull requests ;-) 


Vision
------

Besides the current implementation with [Hoodie](http://hood.ie), we want to add implementations with other noBackend solutions, like (remoteStorage)[http://remotestorage.io/], (deployd)[http://deployd.com/] and (kinvey)[http://www.kinvey.com/]. 

Think of it as [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) for noBackend solutions.
